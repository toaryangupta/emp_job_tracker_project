## Job Tracker

> This web app allows you to keep track of your job applications by creating them and storing in a database. You can also edit or delete existing applications, and view statistics on them: number of declined, pending, scheduled for interview jobs and number of applications created each month.
> To start using the application, you need to create a personal profile/account.
