## Job Tracker

> This web app allows you to keep track of your job applications by creating them and storing in a database. You can also edit or delete existing applications, and view statistics on them: number of declined, pending, scheduled for interview jobs and number of applications created each month.
> To start using the application, you need to create a personal profile/account.

### The goals of creating this application:

The main goals for me as a web developer were to improve my skills in working with:

- MERN stack (Mongoose/MongoDB, Express, React, Node);
- React Router;
- Axios;
- Postman;
- JsonWebToken;
- BcryptJS;
- security packages;
- styled components;
- cookies (cookie-parser)

### To view the app in the browser, copy and paste the following line to your browser URL address bar:

> NOTE: The app is deployed on the basic (free) account of Render.com, so the rendering is slow. It may take up to 60 seconds for app components to load after clicking the website link. Thank you for your patience!

- registering (creating account) / login / logout options;
- editing profile data;
- adding / editing job information (including job title, company name, job type, status, salary range, recruiter's name and email, interview date and time, etc);
- rendering all the job cards created by the user;
- pagination;
- search bar (allows the user to filter the existing jobs by type, status, job title and also sort them alphabetically or by creation time);
- displaying statistics as a chart for a certain period of time (number of declined, pending, scheduled for interview jobs; number of applications created each month);
- deleting jobs from the database;
- responsive design (mobile adaptation)
